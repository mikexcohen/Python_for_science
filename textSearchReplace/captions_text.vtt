00:00.760 --> 00:05.080
I'm now going to give you two more example problems of computing.

1
00:05.080 --> 00:09.310
eigendecomposition of matrices by hand.

2
00:09.310 --> 00:14.860
Obviously this is on the computer but I encourage you to do these problems by hand and they're not done

3
00:14.860 --> 00:15.520
in Matlab.

4
00:15.520 --> 00:19.270
So I guess that's what it means by hand.

5
00:19.270 --> 00:20.530
So let's get started.

6
00:20.560 --> 00:28.030
Here is a two by two matrix and you should pause the video go through find the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors

7
00:28.060 --> 00:37.120
of this matrix so the way we start is by shifting the matrix by Lambda so subtracting lambda from the

8
00:37.120 --> 00:44.260
diagonal elements setting the determinant equal to zero and then proceeding to compute the determinant

9
00:44.290 --> 00:48.820
which is also called the characteristic equation of this matrix.

10
00:48.850 --> 00:57.730
So that works out to be three minus lambda times six minus lambda minus four equals zero and then expanding

11
00:57.760 --> 01:04.600
these two terms multiplying out these two terms and then collecting the like terms gives us lambda squared

12
01:04.960 --> 01:13.930
minus nine lambda plus fourteen equals zero and then this expression here can be factored into lambda

13
01:14.020 --> 01:22.150
minus seven and Lambda minus two and now it's pretty easy to see that the two lambdas that will solve

14
01:22.150 --> 01:24.280
this equation that solve this equation.

15
01:24.280 --> 01:30.910
In other words the two eigenvalues of this matrix are plus 7 and plus two.

16
01:30.910 --> 01:37.180
So that was step one we found the eigenvalues of this matrix and now we go through for each of these

17
01:37.180 --> 01:45.160
eigenvalues shift the matrix by that amount by that value and then figure out what is a vector in the

18
01:45.280 --> 01:48.410
shifted matrices null space.

19
01:48.630 --> 01:50.530
OK so let's start with 2.

20
01:50.580 --> 01:53.610
So this gives us the matrix 1 1 4 4.

21
01:53.610 --> 02:00.360
And now we want to find the missing vector here and you've probably guessed it already it is 1 minus

22
02:00.360 --> 02:01.470
1.

23
02:01.590 --> 02:09.330
And of course you know that also acceptable would be minus 1 1 or minus quadrillion plus quadrillion.

24
02:09.570 --> 02:17.130
This vector simply identifies a subspace for the null space of this shifted matrix in any vector that's

25
02:17.250 --> 02:23.520
in that null space is perfectly fine as an eigenvector.

26
02:23.520 --> 02:31.860
Now that said the best choice for an eigenvector would be a vector that has a norm of 1 a magnitude

27
02:31.860 --> 02:32.710
of 1.

28
02:32.940 --> 02:39.270
And the second best choice would be integer values that are easy to interpret and compact to write like

29
02:39.270 --> 02:40.230
this.

30
02:40.230 --> 02:40.500
All right.

31
02:40.520 --> 02:41.730
So this was for two.

32
02:41.730 --> 02:49.350
Now we go to the second eigenvalues which was seven and that gives us this matrix minus 4 1 and 4 minus

33
02:49.350 --> 02:50.300
1.

34
02:50.370 --> 02:57.210
And here a vector that could work as an eigenvector as a basis for the null space of this shifted matrix

35
02:57.300 --> 02:59.790
is the numbers 1 4.

36
02:59.820 --> 03:06.690
So here is the big picture overview we have this matrix and here you see the eigenvalue and its corresponding

37
03:06.690 --> 03:12.010
eigenvector and the other eigenvalue and the other corresponding eigenvector.

38
03:12.060 --> 03:14.080
Now your results will be correct.

39
03:14.190 --> 03:21.960
If you have the correct pairing of eigenvalue and any multiple any scaled version of this vector; it

40
03:21.960 --> 03:28.860
doesn't matter if you call this lambda one and this V one that's fine because there's no intrinsic ordering.

41
03:28.860 --> 03:32.250
What matters is that you have the pairing correct.

42
03:32.250 --> 03:32.470
All right.

43
03:32.490 --> 03:34.310
So that was the two by two case.

44
03:34.380 --> 03:37.080
Now let's go for a three by three case.

45
03:37.080 --> 03:40.160
This one is a little bit more challenging and I have to admit.

46
03:40.200 --> 03:45.660
So I first came up with these numbers and then I started computing the eigendecomposition.

47
03:45.660 --> 03:50.480
Now I have to admit that I got stuck on one of the eigenvectors.

48
03:50.670 --> 03:52.400
I couldn't quite figure it out on my own.

49
03:52.430 --> 03:54.390
So I used Matlab to compute that

50
03:54.390 --> 03:55.200
eigenvector.

51
03:55.500 --> 04:04.490
So what I encourage you to do is find all three eigenvalues by hand and I think it will be pretty obvious

52
04:04.490 --> 04:08.390
when you start working through it which is the difficult eigenvalue.

53
04:08.390 --> 04:15.530
So then what you should do by hand is find two of the eigenvectors that you can get basically just by

54
04:15.800 --> 04:18.920
kind of eyeballing and making some educated guesses.

55
04:18.920 --> 04:24.860
And then the third eigenvector you can use a computer to solve or you can just wait and watch me come

56
04:24.860 --> 04:26.660
up with a solution.

57
04:26.850 --> 04:27.090
All right.

58
04:27.120 --> 04:34.590
So again we start by shifting this matrix by minus lambda setting the determinant equal to zero and

59
04:34.590 --> 04:40.770
then proceeding to compute the determinant of this equation and altogether that gives us the characteristic

60
04:40.830 --> 04:43.560
equation of this matrix.

61
04:43.560 --> 04:45.270
Now this is a little bit longer.

62
04:45.270 --> 04:50.820
It's a little bit trickier the arithmetic gets a little bit hairy in particular you end up with this

63
04:50.910 --> 04:59.240
minus lambda cubed term as well as a couple of multiple terms with Lambda and Lambda squared.

64
04:59.250 --> 05:05.490
Now once you collect all of these like terms you'll end up with an expression that looks like this.

65
05:05.520 --> 05:15.240
So it should be minus lambda cubed plus 10 times lambda squared plus eleven lambda equals zero Now something

66
05:15.270 --> 05:22.030
interesting has happened here all of these terms have a lambda attached to them which means that we

67
05:22.030 --> 05:29.950
can take a lambda out of each of these terms and rewrite this expression as minus lambda times.

68
05:29.980 --> 05:36.160
All of this stuff and immediately that tells us that lambda equals zero is a solution.

69
05:36.160 --> 05:43.030
So when you set this lambda to be zero it doesn't actually matter what's inside this parenthetical statement

70
05:43.360 --> 05:47.390
that's immediately going to set to make this equation true.

71
05:47.440 --> 05:55.300
That means that one of the eigenvalues of this matrix is zero and I'm going to have an entire video

72
05:55.330 --> 05:59.140
just about this phenomenon a little bit later in this section.

73
05:59.140 --> 06:03.550
But essentially when an eigenvector is an eigenvalue is zero.

74
06:03.730 --> 06:10.360
It means that the matrix is singular and that you can actually see by looking at this matrix and you

75
06:10.360 --> 06:19.080
see that column 1 plus column 2 equals column 3 so whenever you have a singular matrix at least one

76
06:19.140 --> 06:22.110
eigenvalues value is going to be equal to zero.

77
06:22.170 --> 06:30.450
And in fact the number of eigenvalues that are equal to zero tells you about the rank of this matrix.

78
06:30.490 --> 06:33.870
More on that in the later video.

79
06:33.880 --> 06:39.160
Now once you've gotten to this step you can further factor this equation and you end up with the result

80
06:39.160 --> 06:44.360
that lambda equals zero lambda equals minus 1 and Lambda equals eleven.

81
06:44.590 --> 06:50.110
So you can probably guess that this is going to be the tricky I can value to compute the corresponding

82
06:50.110 --> 06:55.600
I can vector of and this is the one that I got a little bit stuck with.

83
06:55.600 --> 06:57.490
And so I used Matlab as a crutch.

84
06:57.490 --> 06:58.540
I cheated a little bit.

85
06:59.250 --> 07:01.500
OK so but let's go through all of these.

86
07:01.840 --> 07:07.840
So we start with zero and now this is kind of a funny thing because we are shifting the matrix by zero

87
07:08.200 --> 07:10.970
which actually means we're not changing the matrix at all.

88
07:11.140 --> 07:21.000
And that means that this matrix A already has a non-trivial null space even without doing any shifting.

89
07:21.130 --> 07:28.010
So this problem actually boils down to finding a vector in the null space or a basis for the null space.

90
07:28.270 --> 07:35.380
Even without doing any shifting so based on what I just told you about how do I set up this matrix that

91
07:35.660 --> 07:42.950
column one plus column two equals column three a basis for the null space is 1 one minus 1.

92
07:42.970 --> 07:49.130
So you can try for each of these rows the first column plus the second column minus the third column

93
07:49.220 --> 07:52.090
equals zero all right.

94
07:52.100 --> 07:53.270
So now let's move on.

95
07:53.270 --> 07:59.350
So now we shift this matrix by eleven and this is basically where I got stuck and switch to matlab.

96
07:59.360 --> 08:04.570
So it turns out that eigenvector is nineteen forty one and thirty six.

97
08:04.580 --> 08:10.430
So if you figured out this I can vector on your own without using a computer then good for you you are

98
08:10.460 --> 08:14.960
a better or at least more patient mathematician than I am.

99
08:15.200 --> 08:19.210
And then we get to the third eigenvalue which was minus one.

100
08:19.220 --> 08:21.130
So now that becomes plus one.

101
08:21.230 --> 08:26.390
And here is that shifted matrix and this one you should be able to solve on your own.

102
08:26.480 --> 08:28.810
In fact it's even easier than it looks.

103
08:28.820 --> 08:35.930
And if you need a hint before I show the answer then the hint is just consider that this third column

104
08:36.020 --> 08:42.340
is actually pretty useless if you get rid of this third column it becomes really easy to find the 

105
08:42.380 --> 08:46.520
eigenvector in this shifted matrices null space.

106
08:46.790 --> 08:52.400
So in fact it's one minus one and then zero you just set the third element to be zero.

107
08:52.670 --> 08:59.810
So that leads us to the big picture overview of the eigendecomposition of this three by three singular

108
08:59.810 --> 09:06.130
matrix rank 2 matrix we have eigenvalues 0 minus 11 and minus 1.

109
09:06.200 --> 09:09.200
And these are the corresponding eigenvectors.

110
09:09.200 --> 09:12.430
And notice I've written them as row vectors and then transpose.

111
09:12.430 --> 09:19.160
So these are still column vectors we generally always think about eigenvectors as column vectors and

112
09:19.160 --> 09:25.640
you will learn more about why that is the case in the video on diagonalization, which is coming up soon.
